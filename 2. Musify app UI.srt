1
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,230
To improve studio, I give this wireframe to you.

2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,110
I know some offshore might done that project.

3
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,800
So who made that project?

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,230
Who can share that project on your story in the Instagram and you can take me with you.

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,420
You can see my Instagram I.D. also.

6
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,420
And you can also share that project on our Discord server.

7
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,480
Then our storm can take inspiration from your project.

8
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,580
Those who not build that project.

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,100
So let's make a project for them.

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,200
So let's create a new one.

11
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,710
So I'm going to make music for it.

12
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,930
It is kind of it sounds like.

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:58,600
I know it to sound like Spotify because I took inspiration from Spotify, so I literally we can take

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:07,480
inspiration from Spotify, audio, music or any you will or any your favorite music player so as to

15
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:07,990
the frame.

16
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,570
Currently, we are how iPhone 13 Max, so we are going to choose this one.

17
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,700
Let's look at our wild thing.

18
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:25,310
So we have things like profile picture logo on the hamburger menu and so on and so on.

19
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,380
So let's clear those things.

20
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,670
OK, now let's create a logo for our music player.

21
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:49,840
So now what do we have to do this time to create this section for our image and also for our song?

22
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,280
So this is a.

23
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:04,940
So anything we have to be is there to add these icons like a dislike, it's like open labor and pause

24
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,840
button and foul and make button.

25
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,840
So let's get those weapons.

26
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,580
Now it is the dark mode is really famous and lots of people are using them.

27
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,420
I'm also one of them, so let's clear their dark mode.

28
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,440
But before we make the dark mode, so let's do the color of these buttons, like if I applied the dark

29
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,470
mode on the frame so everything is going to be black.

30
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:58,060
So our buttons like play pause button, hot button and the dislike button is not going to be visible.

31
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,800
So let's make some changes or you?

32
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,980
If you want to, you can just sit this like three things like a play pause button and forward and backward

33
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,950
button, and you can change the color of the heart button and it's just like button.

34
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,920
You can like, make them white and and these three things would be blue.

35
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,600
So it really depends on you.

36
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:40,440
Soon, the color of the hamburger and also the color of these.

37
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,170
No, that's music play.

38
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,690
Now you can see our logo at the Hamburger is visible London.

39
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,960
OK, what else is remaining is they have to make this certain, I find the bar and display this button

40
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,930
and this menu, the playlist.

41
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,220
So let's make those things.

42
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,950
So we already have this sort of standard.

43
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,000
Bill is with West Ham.

44
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,330
All we have to add time and also this place is.

45
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,790
But it's at a time, audiences.

46
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:19,570
So everything is done, but things are private and the music name and the picture.

47
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,580
So let's add a profile, Victoria.

48
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,070
So let's create a section song name.

49
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,180
Okay.

50
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,800
Or song pages, second song Bridges, oh, sorry.

51
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,480
Listen to that, it's playing this song.

52
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:50,230
OK, so we have done with our music interface, so let's make that Blaze list, no.

53
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,610
Like this one?

54
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,780
So we are done with our head.

55
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,090
So one thing is to many that.

56
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,540
To create a world front page, the first page that is going to be our logo.

57
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,850
So this is my point.

58
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:14,050
So this looks like this, so I know you wouldn't you would ask me then will look different.

59
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:20,410
And in the next video, the last thing is remaining is that to act prototype so that the world is ready

60
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,940
and I will do it in the next one.
