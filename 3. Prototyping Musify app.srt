00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,540
Welcome back in this, we're going to do overtime for our music player.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:05,700
So let's start prototyping.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,430
As you can see, I have four frames on my screen.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,310
Let's start from the first frame.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,040
So select the frame, learn to prototype panel.

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,090
So I'm going to join the first frame to set everything.

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,760
And let's add a smart animation audio.

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,910
And never get to never get to iPhone 13, Pro Max one.

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,330
And the animation is an instant, so let's choose smart animation.

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,620
OK, now to second frame, this is an ostrich in the song.

11
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:40,470
So if you click on this button for Britain, then the song is going to change.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,040
And the film is going to be disturbing.

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,010
So let's choose on one.

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,060
And contoured film user can go on the second line like this.

15
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,700
And all the settings will be sitting on this.

16
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,960
And from here, the playlist is going to open.

17
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,680
Let's choose Martin Mission over here.

18
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,740
I think we are done with protecting so.

19
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,580
So let's prevent it.

20
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:15,450
So it was this that or the smart generation you can see, you can see the logos on the top now.

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,040
And I won't pretend the song, so I'm going to click on this fall button.

22
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,560
This is the second song.

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,340
And from here, I can go back to my first song.

24
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,490
From this playlist bottom, I can access playlist like this.

25
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,390
You can see this cool animation, but I can't go back because I said the protection for this playlist,

26
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,550
so let's do that first.

27
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,030
So from this, it has to go onto the second thing.

28
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,080
Elizabeth smart animation now this played again.

29
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,880
OK, if I click on this button, you can see the list is going Donald.

30
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,210
And just open it again.

31
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,720
Close, you can also see the animation effect audio you.

32
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,280
This looks really cool.

33
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:12,000
So this is the time for our music player app, so the secretaries and others who are in the next room

34
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,190
or in next project.
