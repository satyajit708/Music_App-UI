1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,430
What does a really severe looking backward another video?

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:08,700
So up until now, we return verdicts like this or the Department for Mobile, and the first one is either

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,370
the full delivering app.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:19,260
So for this project, I have to ask for you or you can say or test so that what you have to do is that

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,120
so I have this wire frame.

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:29,090
So this is a wire frame for a music player, so they could have first it and make your own music player

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,270
using this white frame.

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,250
You can name it whatever you want.

9
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:39,060
You can place your preferred songs over here and take inspiration from like Spotify all the way to music.

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,770
And you can use any color you want, or if you want to, like, make a clone of Spotify.

11
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,380
You can also do that, so it all depends on you.

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,570
If something were not able to do this, I'm going to also create that for the after this video.

13
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,190
So stay tuned for that.

14
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,370
So if you're concerned, then go for it and make this project.

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,280
So this is what we do, and I was always in the next one.
